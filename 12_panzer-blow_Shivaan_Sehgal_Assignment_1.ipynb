    "    - For creating that point, you could use a small sphere using `open3d.geometry.create_mesh_sphere`. You already know how to create an axis by now.\n",
    "    - Following our $ZYX$ convention, first rotate your frame about $Z$ axis by an angle, say $-35^{\\circ}$. Then rotate about $Y$ axis by an angle ${\\beta}$ and then about $X$ by say $55^{\\circ}$.\n",
